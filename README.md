## Welcome to my README!
### Who is this guy?
- 🐅 My name is Joey Benich \(he/him\), I'm a student at Clemson University.
- 🖥 I enjoy programming \(surprise!\) and am working my way through a Computer Science degree.
- 🎲 I'm also a fan of rock climbing, board games, VR, puzzles of any kind, and skimboarding when I'm home in Charleston.
### What am I up to or down for?
- 📖 Right now, I'm learning the basics of web design and software engineering.
- 💬 So far I've picked up C, C++, Java, Python, and some HTML and JS, but I'm always looking for more.
- 🔎 I'd like to learn more about cybersecurity and game design if I get the chance going forward.
- 👍 Some of my favorite projects so far are some of my automated solvers for various puzzles and games, check them out!
### Where am I now?
- 📍 Probably on Clemson campus, but if you happen to be looking for college students as interns, I could be wherever you are!
- 📧 If you want to each out to me, try my creatively named email joeybenich@gmail.com.

Nice to meet you!
